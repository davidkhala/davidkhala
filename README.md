### As Linux guy
We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
Quote from Perl community: *Make the easy things easy and the hard things possible*
