### As Linux guy
We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

我们信任您已经从系统管理员那里了解了日常注意事项。
总结起来无外乎这三点：

    #1) 尊重别人的隐私。
    #2) 输入前要先考虑(后果和风险)。
    #3) 权力越大，责任越大。
